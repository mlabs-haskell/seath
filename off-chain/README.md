## Testing

Here are a few tips on how to get started with testing your code.

### Testing with Plutip

[Plutip](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/blob/develop/doc/plutip-testing.md) is a tool that manages local disposable cardano-node clusters that we use to test contracts locally.

- run `npm run test` from Nix shell

### Testing with Blockfrost

[Blockfrost.io](https://blockfrost.io) is an alternative CTL backend that can be used as a subscription service.

- populate the variables in [`test/blockfrost.env`](./test/blockfrost.env) following [this guide](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/blob/develop/doc/blockfrost.md)
- run `npm run blockfrost-test` (no Nix shell required, but the correct versions of [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago/) and [PureScript compiler](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/releases/tag/v0.14.9) must be used)

### Testing with a headless browser

[Headless browser test suite](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/blob/develop/doc/e2e-testing.md) allows to run user contracts with real wallet browser extensions automatically.

- Start the CTL runtime: `nix run -L .#ctl-scaffold-runtime`
- run `npm run e2e-serve` from Nix shell
- run `npm run e2e-test` from Nix shell
